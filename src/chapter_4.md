# Chapter 4: Loops
Before we get into what loops are there's an extra bit I need to talk about [some extra things about variables](./chapter_2.md) which are arrays  

## Arrays  
We explained before that variables are name places in memory big enough for one value, but sometimes we need more than one value, so as an effort not to repeat ourselves, arrays were made.  
Arrays assign a place in memory for multiple values under one name, so say we have a to-do list, trying to make it by adding each of them as a separate variable would be difficult  
```lua
local entry1 = "do your skincare"
local entry2 = "wash the dishes"
local entry3 = "iron your clothes"
```
