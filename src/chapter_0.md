# Chapter 0: Introduction
Helloooo! 0/  
This is meant to be a quick read about the general concepts in programming especially for beginner concepts to programming, however, some advanced concepts may be added later on.  

## Tutorials exist everywhere, why even make this?
Some people, especially beginners, fall into the pretense that you're tied to one framework or programming language, while in reality, a lot of things done by one language can just as easily be done by another, the skills you learn if understood in a general context, are easily transferable between a multitude of other technologies.  

This book aims to give this general context to the basics and maybe intermediate topics of programming.  

## General Outline of what to expect:  
every programming language out there has the following features:  
1. a way to input and output data on screen or to a file
2. a way to store values into some place in memory
3. a way to only do something if a condition is true
4. a way to repeat something being done a set amount of times
5. a way to group code into small repeatable chunks
6. a way to map a blueprint of a set of values into a larger place in memory 

I'll explain those in detail later but generally that's what most programming languages should support, maybe a select few ones might not support number 6.
