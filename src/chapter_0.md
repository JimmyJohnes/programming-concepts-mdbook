# Chapter 0: Introduction
Helloooo! 0/  
This is meant to be a quick read about the general concepts in programming especially for beginner concepts to programming, however, some advanced concepts may be added later on.  

## Tutorials exist everywhere, why even make this?
Some people, especially beginners, fall into the pretense that you're tied to one framework or programming language, while in reality, a lot of things done by one language can just as easily be done by another, the skills you learn if understood in a general context, are easily transferable between a multitude of other technologies.  
This book aims at giving this general context to the basics and maybe intermediate topics of programming
