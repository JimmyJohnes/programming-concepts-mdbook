# Chapter 3: Conditionals  
Sometimes you only want to activate some part of the code only if some condition applies, Say you're creating a login page that only admits one person named "mark" with all lowercase characters.   

## IF statements  
if statements allow us to execute a piece of code *if* a condition applies, otherwise, it'll be ignored and in most programming languages it looks like this:
```c
  if (condition) {
  // do something
  }
```
with some changes like removing the need for parentheses of brackets, or replacing them with a keyword or a way to indicate the start and end of an if statement.
In lua it looks like this:
```lua
  if condition then
    -- do something
    end
```
most programming languages have types of if statements too
